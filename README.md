Image Recognition Classifier

This project accurately determines the house number displayed in images from Google Street 

This is a machine learning project that dives into image processing 

An algorith is fed with many examples of images that have been labelled with the correct number. The algorithm then learns for itself which features distinguish the image, and make a predicton when faced with a new image.
